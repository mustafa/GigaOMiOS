// Subclasses should override this method to parse the results of the connection. Subclasses must
// call the super implementation of this method before executing their own code. If any errors
// occur while parsing, be sure to call setError:. This method will not be called if an error has
// already occurred.

// Subclasses should override this method and notify their caller that the request has completed
// (either successfully or unsuccessfully). Subclasses should call the super implementation if they
// want the basic superclass request methods to work (like performJSONRequest:completionHandler:
// and performBasicRequest:completionHandler:. This method will be called on the main thread.
- (void)notifyCaller;

// The shared request queue for all MBBaseRequest objects. You may override this method to return
// a different queue if you would like to separate some requests from other requests. For example,
// you might want a special queue to handle certain requests which are fast and return very little
// data. This queue could have 20 max concurrent operations while another, slower queue might only
// 2 or 3.
